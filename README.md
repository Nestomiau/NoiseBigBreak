## WARNINGs
This Mod is NOT supposed to be fully accurate to Noise's Big Break(far from it), it includes plenty of new stuff/changes to the original content. If you want the accurate version you should see [lucasdaweb95/NoiseBigBreak](https://github.com/lucasdaweb95/NoiseBigBreak) Wich is the original recreation this mod was build upon, or you could see the [accurate-edition](https://github.com/Nestomiau/ArrozBigBreak/tree/accurate-edition) branch wich include all of the recreations made for this mod, while also not including any of the new modded stuff.

Also you can use any of the recreated stuff from this mod, they are on the [assets/recreation](https://github.com/Nestomiau/ArrozBigBreak/tree/main/assets/recreations) folder.
