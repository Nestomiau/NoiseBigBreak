# Pizza Tower: Arroz's Big Break
Arroz's Big Break(or ABB) is a Mod of Loypoll's recreation of The Noise spinoff seen in the Pizza Tower "Megaleak"
## WARNINGs
This Mod is NOT supposed to be fully accurate to Noise's Big Break(far from it), it includes plenty of new stuff/changes to the original content. If you want the accurate version you should see [lucasdaweb95/NoiseBigBreak](https://github.com/lucasdaweb95/NoiseBigBreak). Wich is the original recreation this mod was build upon.

Also you can use any of the recreated stuff from this mod, they are on the [assets/recreation](https://github.com/Nestomiau/ArrozBigBreak/tree/main/assets/recreations) folder.
