# Pizza Tower: Arroz's Big Break
A Mod of Loypoll's recreation of the Noise spinoff seen in the Pizza Tower "Megaleak"

## WARNINGs
This Mod is NOT supposed to be fully accurate to Noise's Big Break, if you want an accurate version you should see [loypoll/NoiseBigBreak](https://github.com/loypoll/NoiseBigBreak), wich is the original recreation.

Also you can use any of the recreated stuff from this mod, they are on the [aseprite/recreation](https://github.com/Nestomiau/ArrozBigBreak/tree/main/aseprite/recreations) folder + some extra stuff i used to make them.
